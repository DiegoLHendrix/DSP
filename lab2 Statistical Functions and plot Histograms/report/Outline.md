# Lab 2

## Part 1
- Step 1
    - Given variables sample and signal. Signal has 730 samples.
    - Found the max, min, standard deviation, and variance of the signal variable.

- Step 2
    - Created a table with the given function.

- Step 3
    - Plot Data

- Step 4
    - Question
    
- Step 5
    - Histogram

## Part 2
- Step 1
    - Load dataset 2.
    - Found the max, min, standard deviation, and variance of the signal_1, signal_2, and sumSignals.

- Step 2
    - Create a data table.

- Step 3
    - Created an individual plot of each variable signal_1, signal_2 and sumSignal.

- Step 4
    - Plotted an individual histogram of each variable signal_1, signal_2 and sumSignal.

## Part 3 Creating and Computing Statistics of Random Numbers
- Step 1
    - Used the rand() function to create 12 unform random variables that range from 0 to 1 and have a mean of 0.5. 

- Step 2
    - Plotted the histogram of the uniform random numbers in the first column.

- Step 3
    - Created a variable that is the sum of the frist two columns.
    ```cpp
    colSum = randVals(:, 1); + randVals(:, 2)
    ```

- Step 4
    - Plotted the histogram of the sum of the two random variables.

- Step 5
    - Created a variable that is the sum of all 12 random variables.

## Part 4
- Step 1
    - Cleared workspace and loaded new data file.

- Step 2
    - Plotted of the average temperature in Rochester over a two year period.

- Step 3
    - Plot of the error of the measured and average temperature in Rochester over a two year period.

- Step 4
    -
